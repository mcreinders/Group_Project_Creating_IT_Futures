# Group_Project_Creating_IT_Futures
final Prime group project - dashboard for visualization of student data for Creating IT Futures Foundation

The purpose of this project is to create a web-based reporting application for the Creating IT Futures Foundation (CITFF).
Currently, the CITFF manages its data through SmartSheets, and lacks an effective means of visualizing its data.  
Team Creating IT Futures will assist the CITFF by developing a data visualization dashboard which allows staff members
to efficiently navigate and analyze data about their program.  Upon delivery, CITFF staff will be able to use this dashboard
to visualize their data, share the data with business partners, and inform their decisions regarding the future direction
of the program.
